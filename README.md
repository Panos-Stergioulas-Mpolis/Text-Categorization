# Text-Categorization

This project was created as an assignment for my Information Retrieval and Search Engines course at the University of Macedonia.

I had to perform sentiment analysis on a text categorization problem. The objective was to classify texts as either "positive" or "negative". I implemented two programs: one using the Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier and the other using the Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
